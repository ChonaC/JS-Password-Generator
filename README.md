# JS-Password-Generator

## Description

```
As a programer, I have provided the client a way to randomly generate a 
password based on their criteria. The characters can be between 8 - 128 characters and can choose between lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special, or mix of all 4 character types. By doing this, the client is now able to aquire a strong password.
